# Development Guide

This document provides guidelines for developing the advanced blockchain system.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Git

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-blockchain.git
cd advanced-blockchain
```

2. Build the project:

```bash
make build
```

3. Run the tests:

```bash
make test
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following packages:

- `pkg/amf`: Adaptive Merkle Forest implementation
- `pkg/state`: Blockchain state management
- `pkg/crypto`: Cryptographic primitives
- `pkg/consensus`: Consensus mechanisms
- `pkg/network`: Network communication
- `pkg/node`: Node management and authentication
- `cmd/blockchain`: Main application entry point
- `cmd/blockchain-cli`: Command-line interface
- `cmd/blockchain-api`: API server

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes and write tests for them.

3. Run the tests to ensure everything works:

```bash
make test
```

4. Build the project:

```bash
make build
```

5. Run the node to test your changes:

```bash
make run-node
```

6. Commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add your feature or fix"
```

7. Push your changes:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

8. Create a pull request.

## Coding Standards

- Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
- Use `gofmt` to format your code.
- Write tests for your code.
- Document your code using godoc-style comments.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Use error handling consistently.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for all packages.
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate.
- Use the `testing` package for unit tests.
- Use the `testify` package for assertions if needed.
- Run tests with `make test`.

## Documentation

- Document all exported functions, types, and variables.
- Use godoc-style comments for documentation.
- Update the README.md file with any new features or changes.
- Update the documentation in the `docs` directory as needed.

## Versioning

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version for new functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- PATCH version for backward-compatible bug fixes

## Release Process

1. Update the version number in the code.
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md file.
3. Create a new release branch:

```bash
git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z
```

4. Build and test the release:

```bash
make build
make test
```

5. Tag the release:

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

6. Merge the release branch into the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge release/vX.Y.Z
git push origin main
```

7. Create a new release on GitHub with release notes.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and write tests for them.
4. Run the tests to ensure everything works.
5. Commit your changes.
6. Push your changes to your fork.
7. Create a pull request.
